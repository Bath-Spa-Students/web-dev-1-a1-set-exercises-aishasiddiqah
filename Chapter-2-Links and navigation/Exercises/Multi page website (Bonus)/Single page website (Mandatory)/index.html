                Plot Overview
            </h1>
            <p> <!-- p tag for adding text paragraphs -->
                A drop of sunlight falls from the sky and produces a magic flower with healing properties. An old woman, Gothel uses it to retain her youth. Centuries later, the flower is taken by soldiers from the kingdom of Corona and used to save their pregnant and ailing queen, who gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. Gothel sneaks into the castle and discovers that Rapunzel's hair inherited the flower's magic but turns powerless when cut. To keep the flower's magic, Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods. Each year on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns, hoping they will guide Rapunzel home.<br><br>

Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks to leave the tower and investigate them, but Gothel refuses, claiming the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace; he abandons the Stabbington brothers, his partners in crime, while being pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus. Flynn discovers and takes refuge in the tower, where Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him in a closet. When Rapunzel attempts to show him to Gothel as proof that she can defend herself, Gothel berates Rapunzel and says Rapunzel will never leave the tower. Hatching a plan, Rapunzel asks for new paint as a gift, sending Gothel on a three-day journey.<br><br>

Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return the crown in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns. When they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides. When royal guards arrive, the thugs help Rapunzel and Flynn escape. Meanwhile, Gothel encounters a riderless Maximus and recognizes him as a horse from the palace. Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the empty tower, and finds the crown and a wanted poster of Flynn. She strikes a deal with the Stabbington brothers to find Rapunzel. Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave; believing they will suffocate, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel uses the magic glow of her hair to reveal a hidden exit beneath the water, and they escape. That night, Gothel confronts Rapunzel alone and gives her the crown, telling her to give it to Eugene to test his loyalty.<br><br>

The next morning, Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him, but Rapunzel demands a truce, which Maximus reluctantly agrees to. Rapunzel and Eugene enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the "lost princess". After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their mutual love. When Eugene sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown. The brothers tie him up, tricking Rapunzel into thinking he abandoned her. They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a rescue by knocking them out and takes Rapunzel back to the tower. <br><br>

Eugene is arrested, but Maximus and the pub thugs help him escape. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard, a golden sun, into her artwork throughout her life. Realizing that she is the "lost princess", she confronts Gothel, declaring she will never allow Gothel to use her hair again. Eugene arrives at the tower and calls to Rapunzel. Her hair is lowered to him but, upon climbing up, he finds Rapunzel chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Eugene from behind and attempts to drag Rapunzel away, but she angrily resists. However, Rapunzel promises to stay with Gothel if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees to this, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off most of her hair before she can heal him. A horrified and infuriated Gothel suddenly ages rapidly, then falls from the tower and turns to dust. <br><br>

Rapunzel mourns Eugene, but one of her tears, which still has some of the flower's magic, revives him. In the aftermath, Rapunzel is reunited with her birth parents, and the kingdom celebrates. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry. <br><br>

                Main Characters
            </h1>
            <p><b>Rapunzel</b><br>
                Princess Rapunzel, born with long hair as the result of the power of the sun drop, was kidnapped by Mother Gothel so she could use the power of Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel eventually escapes with Flynn Rider and goes on an adventure that changes her life. Always optimistic and searching for the brighter side of things, Rapunzel does all she can to help her friends and family by showing that nothing can keep her down.
            </p>
            <p><b>Flynn Rider</b><br>
                Eugene Fitzherbert, born Horace and better known as Flynn Rider, was abandoned by his father in order to protect him. Flynn grew up as a cocky thief. His luck changed when he found himself unwillingly rescuing Rapunzel from a tall tower. Since then, he has fallen in love with her and has changed his ways to be by her side by protecting her at all costs until he eventually weds her. He is shown to prefer Eugene as his name in Tangled the Series.
            </p>
            <p><b>Pascal</b><br> 
                Pascal is a chameleon who was washed away one rainy night until he found himself adopted by a young Rapunzel. Considered Rapunzel's best animal friend, Pascal is ever loyal to her and despite his small appearance, hides boundless energy that always comes in handy when protecting his friends.
            </p>
            <p><b>Maximus</b><br>
                Maximus is a horse for the royal guard. For years, he has been dead set on bringing in Flynn Rider to face his crimes. However, due to Rapunzel's influence and Flynn's eventual reformation, Maximus has become one of their closest allies. A strong, sturdy and reliable horse, Maximus is more of a soldier than the actual soldiers in Corona.
            </p>
            <p><b>Mother Gothel</b><br>
                Mother Gothel is the main antagonist of Tangled. Her actual age is around 400 years old, and due to this Gothel became obsessed with regaining her youth. She was ultimately forced to kidnap Rapunzel and raise her as her own at the cost of abandoning her birth daughter, Cassandra. Gothel mostly cares for her own vanity and while she brings out her maternal instincts, underneath it all she is a cruel and sinister woman who will not stop at anything to get what she wants.
            </p>
            <p><b>Stabbington Brothers</b><br> 
                Sideburns and Patchy Stabbington are unrelenting twin criminals. They are recognized by their tall intimidating appearances, scarred features and orange hair. As their names imply, one has noticeable sideburns and wears a green tunic and leather arm bands while one has an eye patch and black leather tunic with long sleeves. While both are credited, only Sideburns actually speaks while Patchy is silent. They first appear in Tangled; having teamed up with Flynn Rider (Eugene Fitzherbert) to steal the royal tiara from Corona. Eugene betrays the two and they are captured by the royal guards. They manage to escape and plot revenge, only to run into Mother Gothel who hires the two of them to not only get back at Eugene, but also to get Rapunzel. She of course betrays the two and they are captured once again. They briefly appear in Tangled Forever After where they have apparently reformed, though still imprisoned, and are in attendance of Eugene and Rapunzel's wedding, bawling during the reception.
            </p>
            <p><b>Hook Hand</b><br> 
                Hook Hand is a big, bald man with a hook for a hand. He wishes to be a concert pianist despite his missing limb. He succeeds and begins to go on tour making him completely absent from the series. He eventually returns in "The Brothers Hook" where he hypocritically looks down on his brother Hook Foot's dream of being a dancer. With Rapunzel's help, they ultimately make up and Hook Hand asks his brother to tour with him, to which he accepts. He is also the only pub thug that still dislikes Eugene.
            </p>
            <p><b>Big Nose</b><br> 
                Big Nose is a goofy-looking thug with, as his name implies, a big nose. He sings that he has extra toes, a goiter, and apparently a really bad complexion. He wishes to have someone to love, as he is apparently a romantic type. At the end of the movie, he meets a young lady. In the series, Eugene reveals that the woman's name is Assunta. He joins Eugene, Cassandra, Lance, and the people of Corona to fight against Varian's automatons. Eventually, he joins the final battle to defend Corona and fight Zhan Tiri.
            </p>
            <p><b>Vladimir</b><br> 
                Vladimir is a giant intimidating man with helmet adorned in large horns. Despite his large appearance, he would rather collect tiny ceramic unicorns, which he is passionate about. This was Richard Kiel's final role before his death. He helps Eugene, Cassandra, Lance and the people of Corona fight against Varian's automatons. Eventually, he joins the final battle to defend Corona and fight Zhan Tiri.
            </p>
            <p><b>Attila Buckethead</b><br>
                Attila Buckethead is a thug who wears a metal helmet that covers his face. He actually loves to bake and is a natural at it. The reason for his helmet is that he is "repugnant" underneath, but also really shy. He was kicked out of the kingdom after being accused of blowing up Monty's candy store, but thanks to Rapunzel was proven innocent, while Eugene, Cassandra, Lance and the people of Corona fight against Varian's automatons. Eventually, he joins the final battle to defend Corona and fight Zhan Tiri.
            </p>
            <p><b>Shorty </b><br> 
                Shorty is a short, white-bearded thug who always seems to be in a state of inebriation. He is very friendly, but is aloof and constantly utters slurs and has a habit of getting people's names wrong. He is shown to be surprisingly observant and sometimes ends up coming in handy. He disguised himself as Rapunzel to fool Varian but the disguise failed. He joins Rapunzel's entourage, albeit accidentally, when they traveled to the dark kingdom. Eventually, he joins the final battle to defend Corona and fight Zhan Tiri.
            </p>
            <p><b>Ulf</b><br> 
                Ulf is a thug who wants to be a mime. He communicates entirely through miming actions and only Shorty seems to be capable of translating it.

            </p>
